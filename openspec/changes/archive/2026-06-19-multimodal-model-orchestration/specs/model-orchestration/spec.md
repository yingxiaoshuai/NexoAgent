## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Single primary orchestrator profile
The system MUST allow exactly one enabled model profile to be marked as the primary orchestrator, and the runtime MUST use that profile as the default planning model when one is configured.

#### Scenario: Save a new primary profile
- **WHEN** the user marks a profile as primary and saves it
- **THEN** the system clears the primary flag from any other saved profiles

#### Scenario: Use the primary orchestrator
- **WHEN** a user sends a normal chat request and a primary profile exists
- **THEN** the runtime uses that profile for planning and top-level reasoning

#### Scenario: Fall back without a primary
- **WHEN** no enabled profile is marked as primary
- **THEN** the runtime falls back to the existing default chat model settings

### Requirement: Capability-based specialist resolution
The system MUST resolve specialist work by capability tag rather than by raw model ID, and it MUST skip disabled profiles when selecting a specialist.

#### Scenario: Resolve a vision specialist
- **WHEN** the runtime requests a model with the vision capability
- **THEN** the system returns an enabled profile tagged for vision work

#### Scenario: Skip a disabled match
- **WHEN** the only matching specialist profile is disabled
- **THEN** the system does not select that profile and reports that no enabled specialist is available

### Requirement: Deterministic routing for multiple matches
When more than one enabled profile satisfies a requested capability, the system MUST choose a single profile using deterministic rules and must not depend on manual model-name entry.

#### Scenario: Multiple specialists satisfy one capability
- **WHEN** two or more enabled profiles are tagged for the same capability
- **THEN** the system chooses one profile consistently using the same priority rules each time

#### Scenario: User switches provider connection
- **WHEN** the user updates provider base URL or API Key for a profile
- **THEN** the routing logic continues to work from capability tags without requiring a new manual model-name lookup
